🌿 Welcome to the 🌱Plant Disease Detection🌱 Web App 🌿

This is a deep learning-based web application that detects plant diseases from uploaded leaf images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. It is trained on the PlantVillage dataset.

🤖 Features

Upload plant leaf images via web interface

Predicts plant disease from the image

CNN-based model trained on 38 plant disease classes

Modern responsive UI with animations and dark/light mode toggle
